The problem description method is a good way for you to know your product

For a NEW PRODUCT you can use the following template:

Template: 
    We observed that: 
    That makes:
    Suffers with:
    
    
An example would be:

  We observerd that:  It is hard to develop something in a Blokchain Ecossystem
  That makes: The users and the developers
  Suffers with: Very little options and incentives to invest their time to the ecossystem.
  
  
  

For an ALREADY EXISTING PRODUCT you can use the following template: 
    The:
    Offers:
    So that:
    Can:
    
    
    We observed that: 
    That makes:
    Suffers with:
    
By adding the previous questions/information, we know that this is an already existing product, even though the template may seem very similar (and indeed they are) this could give us a deeper insight on what the product REALLY does instead of what we can only see!

An example would be:

    The: Cardano
    Offers: A Blockchain
    So that: Users
    Can: Experience true ownership of their digital assets
    
    
    We observerd that:  It is hard to develop something in a Blokchain Ecossystem
    That makes: The users and the developers
    Suffers with: Very little options and incentives to invest their time to the ecossystem.
    


From that it is easier to find a solution to your problem
